# **Functions in R**

R has multiple options that are useful for the analysis of microbiome data.

1.  **Set up functions**

[Get or Set Working Directory]{.underline}

`setwd(dir)` is used to set the working directory to `dir`. `dir` would be consider the root folder.

Example: `setwd("documents/project")`

[Install and load libraries]{.underline}

`install.packages()` Download and install packages from CRAN-like repositories or from local files. This function must be use once if the require package is not installed.

`libraries()` Load pre-install packages. This function must be use every time a new session starts
