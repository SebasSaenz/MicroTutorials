# **What is R?**

R is a free programming language and software environment that is broadly use for data wrangling, statistical computing and graphical representation. It can be run on a wide variety of UNIX platforms, Windows and MacOS.

[The R project](https://www.r-project.org) is a collaborative effort between the R developers and its community. Every R user can develop its own packages to run in the R environment and solve different problems or necessities. R is quite powerful but it can be challenging to use. Because of that we used [R-studio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/), which is an integrated development environment (IDE). This IDE includes a console, syntax-highlighting editor that supports direct code execution, and tools for plotting, history, debugging, and workspace management.

Please follow the following guide to install R and R-studio.

## Installing R

1.  Go to [The R project](https://www.r-project.org) website and click on download R.

5.  I usually do not install the last version available, in this case R-4.3.0. I prefer to to install a previous version, which would not have compatibility issues with some of the libraries or packages that I currently use. Go and click on "Previous releases"

6.  Select the version R-4-2.2, which have been stable during the last year. Go ahead and download the .exe file and install it. After, follow the basic installation. **I recommend you to install R in English not in German**. If you are in a MacOS machine be aware that there are different versions for the intel-based Macs and arm-based macs.

You can download the last version available of RStuio, follow the basic installation. **I recommend you to install RStudio in English not in German**.
