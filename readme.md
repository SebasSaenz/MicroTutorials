# MicroTutorials

The Microtutorials blog contains several guides, which describe how to analyse microbiome data mainly using R. The tutorials are specifically designed for master students of the Hohenheim University without previous programming or data analysis knowledge. The data and the code were generated for the course "*Interaktionen Mikrobiom-Nutztier*" designed by [Prof. Jana Seifert](https://livestock-functional-microbiology.uni-hohenheim.de/jana-seifert) and [Johan S. Sáenz](https://sebassaenz.github.io/website/).

Please explore the blog and reach out if you have any comments. If you want to know more about our research have a look at the [HOLMIR](https://holmir.uni-hohenheim.de) website. Drawings display in the website were drawn by me, you can use them but give me (Johan S. Sáenz) the corresponding credit.
